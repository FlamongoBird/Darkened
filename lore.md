*The rebellion has failed*

*all hope has been lost*


It turns out those who said resistance was futile were correct. Our attempt at freedom only costed us tens of thousands of lives, and for what?

*Shere Vekk Ce'd* ... Evil lives on.

Our kingdom has been laid to waste. Our people enslaved, dragged to the dark place.

Fields have been burned, castles sacked, villages razed. 

They were right. Resistance is futile. We will never win.

Their army is too strong, too organized, too well equiped.

But our goal is no longer resitance, we no longer strive for freedom. The dark ones have taken everything from us, left us with nothing, taken away our reasons to leave, but at the same time given us one.

Take everything from someone, kill their family, burn their home, destroy their fields, and you've just given them one reason to keep on living, one incredibly powerful reason to keep on going. 

Revenge. 

Our goal is not to resist, to defeat our enemies. Our goal is vengeance.

Today we attack. Today we avenge our kingdom, our loved ones, ourselves.

No mercy for the enemy. No quarter. No surrender. No Survivors. 

We will kill them until they kill us. 

This is not war. This is vengeance.


---

These were the last known words of Sir Fredrich (Fox) Variks. A known traitor and political dissident.

Two days after spreading this anger inciting letter, Sir Fredrich along with thirty four of his cultists executed one of the most brutal terrorist attacks our nation has ever faced.

Their attacks in the capitol ended the lives of over eight thousand innocents. News of their attack incited other terrorist attacks accross the kingdom, resulting in thousands more lost lives.

Today we mourn the innocent lives lost in these terrible attacks. This day serves as a reminder to show the terrible things that human's are capable of, and why we must remain ever strong in our conquor of their race. Until they have submitted to their masters, or until we have exterminated ever single one of them, our kingdom remains weak. 

Under the constant threat of attacks such as these. 

Perhaps you want to do something about these attacks, is there something in you that drives you to protect and serve your poeple?

The Grand Zigorian Army is accepting recruits today. Find your purpose, serve your kingom, and protect your family.





## Story

You play as a young Zigorian Dark one. Similar to a human, but taller, stronger, and pitch black skin and no face. Dark Ones do not need to eat. But the sun will burn them quickly, so they keep themselves covered in the day and mostly go about at night. they can see extremely well in the dark.

After joining the Grand Zigorian Army as a private, you go on several missions to attack rebels and are promoted to a corporal. From here you can continue to do missions for the GZA or you can join the rebels. 
If you stay in the GZA, you will eventually reached lance corporal, seargent, luetenent, captain, commander, and general. Once you reach commander you will be given your own castle. As you get higher in rank you have more soldiers (companions) under you who will obey your orders. 
If you do not join the rebels while a commander, you will no longer have the option. You can continue to the rank of lord, but it is the highest rank you can receive. 

If you join the rebels, you will start as an informant, doing missions to spy on the GZA. You can rank up in rebels from informant, to spy, then master spy. From here you can be Knighted. The longer you were in the GZA the longer it takes to rank up in the rebels as they do not trust you as much. 

There are some shared missions you can choose to accept, such as quests for merchants as well as some bounty hunting work. 

If you are in the rebels and you are captured, you can be given the option to turn in your companions and recieve gold. You will now be neither a rebel nor a Zigorian, but a traitor. 

Traitors are given the "traitor" rank and have no main missions. You can still do side quests and gather gold. Traitors can attack anyone, rebels, zigorian soldiers, or other traitors.
