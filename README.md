# Notes

I've included a lot of comments in the code so that hopefully it is easy to understand what's going on. If you run into any issues or don't understand something go ahead and reach out to me, I'm trying to be better about answering peoples questions more quickly, but it might take me a few days to see your comment, I promise I'm not trying to ignore you. 

Adding onto that; please try and describe your problem as thouroughly as possible, "it's broken" doesn't really tell me much and doesn't help me to help you. If possible include the code using backticks like this:

```py
print"Hello, World!"
```

And any error messages also in backticks

```
File "main.py", line 1
    print"Hello, World!")
         ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```
