Completed Goals:




## Attacking

press `a` to attack. A will highlight your range us bg. Press enter/space to attack if there is only a single enemy in your range, or you can select a specific enemy using the arrow or wasd keys. The enemy you are to attack is lit up (probably using the reverse ansi code) Or you will be alerted if there are no enemies in range with the weapon you have equiped.



## Popups

popups should be printed in the center of the screen. The complete border should be drawn, then cursor position can be changed to typewriter style print stats (very quickly though so as not to be boring) about player attacks etc. Popups can also be used for characters talking with the player. Can also be used for `help` or `h` to let the player know how to do stuff. Same for exit game etc.
